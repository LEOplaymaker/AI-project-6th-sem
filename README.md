# Student Performance Prediction
This is a simple machine learning project using classifiers for predicting factors which affect student grades, using data from CSV file


In this Project, a dataset which has students from nationalities, different grade levels and also some determining factors like,
number of hands raised, nuber attendances, number of hours studied etc. is used to train the model, which is a CSV File.


A few different classifiers and ML models have been used to get accurate predictions of which factors,
affect the marks of students.

A few visual aids like graphs and confusion matrix have been created, to show the results.
